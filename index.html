        <h1>🐘 Mastodon Tools 🛠</h1>

        <p>
            Hey there 👋
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a page where I host an assortment of smaller Mastodon tools, either for admins or users.
            Some tools require you to login to your Mastodon account, some require you to use your "Mastodon Session ID" and "Session ID".
        </p>

        <p>
            If you have any questions feel free to @ me over on <a href="https://gamedev.lgbt/@MastodonTools" rel="me">MastodonTools@gamedev.lgbt</a>!<br>
            If you want to follow the creator of these tools, follow <a href="https://gamedev.lgbt/@bram" rel="me">bram@gamedev.lgbt</a>! ✨
        </p>

            Don't just authorize any app to your Mastodon Instance or Mastodon account, serious damage can be done by giving your account or instance away to bad actors
